## Xibo - A digital signage CMS application 

This example project uses `docker-compose.yml` file from https://github.com/xibosignage/xibo-docker and creates IEAM deployment files so that application can be deployed on IEAM. Access the deployed application as `http:<ip-address-of-your-edge-node>`.  

### Notes

IEAM uses `semver` naming scheme for releases. cms, xmr and ianw images had to be re-tagged and pushed into another repository to make the service publishing possible in IEAM.

### Setup
Setup following ENV variables to publish the service, pattern and register the edge node.

#### Enviornment variables EDGE_OWNER, EDGE_DEPLOY to identify service. Change as needed to organize your service, policy names etc.

```
export EDGE_OWNER=<change-as-needed> e.g sg.edge           
export EDGE_DEPLOY=<change-as-needed> e.g example.xibo 

#### Specify your docker login name
